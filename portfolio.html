    <h3>This is my first project in the CSP class. The game functions as an
    Ice cream Shop and thus allows the user to choose a variety of flavors
    to make an Ice Cream from. This also utilizes the current turtle methods
    for example trtl.goto and such. This also utilizes while and if statements, but does 
    not utilize the definition functions yet. Overall, this is a simple ice cream maker game that allows the user to simulate ordering an ice cream from an ice cream parlor.</h3>
